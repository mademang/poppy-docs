The Poppy Ergo Jr robot was thought to be a simple little robot, cheap and easy to use.
The 3D parts were made so they can be easily printed on a basic 3D printer and the motors (6 XL-320 Dynamixel servos)  are only 20$ each.
It is possible to program the robot but also to record the exact position of the motors or memorize a sequence of positions, it's called the programming demonstration.
Unlike others Poppy creatures, the electronic card is not integrated, which is very advantageous to manipulate.

It is very easy to build and its end can be easily modified (At the end of his arm, you can choose among several ends: a lamp, a hand gripper, ...) thanks to OLLO  rivets that are very simple to remove. These rivets can be removed and added very quickly with the OLLO tool, which allows great design freedom.

This Ergo Poppy Jr is ideal for start manipulating robots and for learning robotic without difficulties.

This robot was designed to be assembled as soon as possible (within one hour): in fact, only a few steps are necessary.

* You need to collect all the necessary parts to build the robot (6 motors, 6 wires, the 3D printed parts, many OLLO rivets, etc...), you can find the complete list in the assembly part.

* You assemble all the rivets

* Once assembled, you use rivets to put the motors on 3D printed parts. For this, you have the OLLO tools, it's really convenient. This tool allows to put and remove the rivets easily.

*Start assembling from below, remembering to connect wires. 
The cables between motors have two purposes:
- distribute alimentation to each motor
- convey messages to each motor (ordering them to move or asking them for sensors' values)

*Put motors one after the other...

* ... until the end !

* You can add the end of your choice !

* A small bit of electronic hacking is required for now. You need to power the Xl320 motors with 7.5V.

*It's finish, you have a Poppy Ergo Jr
